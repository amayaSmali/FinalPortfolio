                        With my internship at CAIDA, I was assigned the task to create a new logo for their new project: P.A.N.D.A. This is still currently in process so this is the process I have made so far.

                    <p>
                            This is a individual task I created all designs and uploaded for feedback.

                                For the PANDA logo, this task was a redesign. The current logo is the above image.

                        </p> <br>
    
                        <p>
                           I went on the project profiles and read about the project and what it is used for. Its a platform that acts as a hub for resources and tools and a user can combine individual resources and tools. I went into sketching. I sketched various different ways to resemble data, platforms, and pieces coming together.      
                        </p></br>
                        <image src="PANDA_logo1.png" class="center" width="550" height="400"> V.1</image>
                        <p>
                             I sent this to my supervisor and I got feedback to add panda graphics as suggestions.       
                             </p></br>
                        <image src="PANDA_logo1.2.png" class="center" width="550" height="400">V.1.2</image>
                        <p>
                            These were sent to the rest of the programmers and principal investigators and I got more feedback.
                        </p></br>
                        <p>
                            Some suggested to put more emphasis on the idea of data and pieces coming together and a bonus would be to have a panda as a hidden image. I started looking at inspiration from pipes, roads and puzzle pieces. I sketched realistic pieces of pipes, roads and puzzles and then abstracts of them. I looked towards emphasizing the data functions more than the art and panda idea. I also created ideas that have the escher style.
                        </p> </br>

                        <image src="PANDA_logo2.png" class="center" width="550" height="550"></image>

                        <p>
                           My supervisor and I decided to stick with the cube idea but also try to play with the word 'PANDA' so I went back to the whiteboard 
                        </p>
                        <image src="PANDA_logo2.5.png" class="center" width="550" height="550"></image>

                        <p>
                            It was ready to be sent to the other programmers and principal investigator and they all preferred B2, horray! Progress! I went back to the whiteboard to do various colors. Some suggested to have a panda in the cube design as well so I made those variations as well. 
                        </p></br>
                        <image src="PANDA_logo3.png" class="center" width="750" height="500"></image>
                        <p>
                            There was a lean towards warmer color schemes and to have the panda dipping into a pool of data
                        </p></br>
                        <image src="PANDA_logo3.1.png" class="center" width="750" height="500"></image>
                        <p>
                                One of the phases of design is going back. After posting these designs, we realized that the cube idea for the logo doesn't emphasize data enough. So I went on a call with other principle investiagators and go more feedback, asked questions about ideas and what words they imagined and resources they had. I ended the call and went to work with 9 radical designs. 
                            </p></br>

                        <p>
                            This is where I left off and while this is a continuing project I put this in my portfolio to show my design process and how I work with illustrator.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the near future, I will be looking at ideas to use more pipe-like images and more emphasis on puzzles.
                        </p>
