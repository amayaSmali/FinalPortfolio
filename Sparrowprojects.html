                    <p> For my usability course. My group and I wanted to delve into the struggles of health insurance and target low income families in California. We designed an app to organize and manage health forms and billing while translating medical terminology.

                    <p>
                            My role in this project was Content and Market Stragetist, I also designed the find health care provider text feature.

                                We got this idea through a fast paced brainstorming session on what public health applications could be created with out any technology or world limitations. We narrowed it down to looking at insurance and a patients experience at the doctor. Our group went into research to look at waht are the struggles of going to the doctor. We found that the health insurance process and understanding benefits and what a patients health insurance offers is overwhelming. We also found that a large percentage of people speak different languages and this got us thinking: What happens when there is a language barrier between the patient and the doctor?

                        </p> <br>
    
                        <p>
                           We began storyboarding different scenarios and personas for the use of an translating health insurance app.      
                        </p></br>
                        <image src="storyboarding.png" class="center" width="550" height="400">The storyboard I made. Shows two users of the app and how they use it for different reasons. One to find healthcare and one to find insurance</image>
                        <p>
                             We made sure to look at the details of each persona and how they would use the app. After this we went into lo-fi prototyping.       
                             </p></br>
                        <image src="lofiprototype.png" class="center" width="550" height="400">The lofi prototype I made</image>
                        <image src="lofiusertesting.png" class="center" width="550" height="400"></image> </br>
                        <p>
                            after lo-fi user testing we got more feedback on what to include with the app and what is not working and what if. Our team went back to the drawingboard on what flows to focus on and what flows to take out. Our key objective is to make the experience of going to the doctors easy and less stressful. For patients to not be intimdated with the language barrier or not understanding what their health insurance will cover and what to know about follow-up and billing. 
                        </p></br>
                        <p>
                            We went back to the storyboard process and created new personas with the redesigns we made. After creating the new storyboards we went forward with the high fidelity prototypes.

                        <image src="high-fidelity.png"></image>

                        <p>
                            This was the flow I designed for users finding health care and then making an appointment after 
                        </p>
                        <image src="findhealthcare.gif" width="300" height="550"></image>

                        <p>
                            Overall, our objectives with this app is to emphasize a simple way to go through healthcare and breaking the barriers with language. 
                        </p></br>
                        <p>
                            further work would go into:
                            - putting more emphasis on the language translation flow
